# C# Snake
In pursuit of enhancing coding proficiency while making the learning process enjoyable, I have endeavored to create a captivating mini-game inspired by the classic Snake. This undertaking aims to integrate a clearly defined objective with a streamlined and efficient codebase, emphasizing minimal requirements for accessibility. 

The primary intent behind this project is to improve my own understanding of C# and add an element of fun into the otherwise rigorous process of learning coding, recognizing the motivational benefits derived from engaging in enjoyable coding exercises.
